★Starring----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

　♂Saotome Reguma 		Type A	：He pretends to be a pervert, a ladies' man, and a hikikomori. Really, he's quite thoughtful.
　♀Tokonatsu "Hamuko" Kimiko 	Type B	：A bit of an airhead. She loves action games, but only plays on easy mode - they aren't her strong suit. Full breasts.
　♀Harukaze "Nyanko" Tama 	Type O	：Total tsundere. An all-round athlete, a keen intellect, and a great cook. Behind her harsh manner of speaking, she's nicer than anyone. Beautiful breasts.
　♀Akizora "Tomocchi" Tomoe	Type B	：Reckless. A self-sufficient troublemaker stuffed full of tomboy-ish charm. Despite her loli looks, she has an erotic personality. Lonely breasts.
　♀Kiryuu "Hime" Orihime		Type B	：Not a people-person, but wants to be a sharp-minded detective. Often stares off into space. A highly sheltered princess-like girl. Precious breasts.


★Translator Trivia-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

　Hamuko's real name wasn't always "Kimiko"... it was just Hamuko!
　Nyanko got her nickname because Hamuko think she's "cat-like".
　Before the events of the game, it is said that Tomocchi was the oldest of the four girls whe she last wet herself, at around age 12.
　Hime's real name comes from a real place name: Orihimecho is a town in Kiryushi, Gunma prefecture.
　Ao Kurage's ideal configuration:
　　Hamuko = Girlfriend
　　Nyanko = Wife
　　Tomocchi = Little Sister
　　Hime = Kouhai (Underclassman)
